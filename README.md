koziolekweb
===========

Main repo for my blog notes. I think I need this one now...


The blog
----------------

[Koziolekweb.pl](http://koziolekweb.pl) is my personal blog. I started writing it at 2007 and for now I wrote over 870 posts. Many of them about non-tech subjects like music, books or society. Most are in polish, but tech-posts contains lot of code listings so I think they could be understood without knowledge about polish language.


The repo
----------------

So far I create new repository for each "big blog project". Some of this repos lay on google code, some on github, some say devil know where. 
Since now I will add all code that will appear on blog to this repo. I think it is time for create one point of access to blog code.
